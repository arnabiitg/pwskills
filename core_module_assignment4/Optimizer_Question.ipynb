Local optima are points in the parameter space where the loss function reaches a minimum but is not the global minimum. GD can get trapped in local optima if the initial parameter values are chosen poorly. However, in practice, local optima are often not a significant concern due to the high dimensionality of many machine learning problems. Techniques like random initialization, using different learning rates, and using variations of GD (such as momentum or adaptive learning rate) can help overcome local optima."
